Installation
- Any Java compiler over version 17 should be able to compile the project and run it. I used IntelliJ
- Used maven for dependencies, using normal "junit:junit:4.12" for tests.
- Just compile and run, and the instructions should show in the CLI on your terminal or IDE.

Code Organization
- Tests are in the src/test folder, they should correspond to the ones in the exercise overview
- Main code path is in src/main.
